Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Prompts the user for their genre of choice, converts their choice to a TMDb API genre ID, prints up to 5 movie recommendations using the TMDb API, and displays the movie title, overview, and release date. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Display movie posters with the movie recommendations, bring the project into Ren'Py, use something like ChatGPT as a middleman to create unbiased, more specific, and personalized movie recommendations. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The API handling is a bit confusing, I will have to learn my way around Ren'Py and incorporate AI models into my code.
